# Lottery-with-Scikit-Learn

In this project I've decided to play with scikit-learn library  and data from the most popular polish lottery "Lotto"

I am not mathematician, so a lot of research were involved in this project. 

Purpous of this project is pure fun and play with data. 

Kudos to authors of below articles and documentations which helped me uderstand subject.
